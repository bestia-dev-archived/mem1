Learning to use Rust Wasm/Webassembly with Dodrio Virtual Dom on a simple memory game for kids.  
The next iteration of this project is here:  https://github.com/LucianoBestia/mem2  
The images are funny cartoon characters from the alphabet.  
The cards grid is only 4x4.

## Source
Absolutely everything manually coded is in Rust language in the file `/src/lib.rs`.  
No manual javascript or HTML needed.  
The index.html file is a standard scafold.  
The pkg/mem.js file is generated by wasm-bindgen.  
I prepared a small simple mem1.css with flex objects for styling.   
No need for npm or web-pack.
## Build
Run in mem1/ folder
```
wasm-pack build --target no-modules
```
## Serve
Run the html server in mem1/ folder in a second terminal.
So it can continuosly run while you incrementaly build your changes in the first terminal.
```
basic-http-server
```
If you don't have it yet on your machine, install it with:
```
cargo install basic-http-server
```
Open the default URI in your browser
http://localhost:4000/  
# Memory game rules
The game starts with a grid of 8 randomly shuffled card pairs face down - 16 cards in all.  
The first player flips over two cards with two clicks.  
If the cards do not match, the next player starts his turn with a click to turn both cards back face down. Then two clicks to flip over two cards.  
If the cards match, they are left face up and the player receives a point and continues with the next turn. No additional third click needed in that case.  
This is a programming example for Rust Webassembly Virtual Dom application. 
For the sake of simplicity, it is made as for single player mode.
