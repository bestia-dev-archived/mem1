mem1 is the first iteration of the game development.
I stopped it in this phase so that it is easy to read and understand step by step by new developers in Rust Wasm.
It is more like a tutorial for learning Rust Wasm/Webassembly with Dodrio Virtual Dom.
The second iteration is bestia-dev/mem2 on GitHub. That is the place for refactoring and enhancement.

Your contribution is welcome. It should achieve more readable and understandable code and instructions,
but not adding complexity for newcomers.

Thank you.
